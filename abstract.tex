% The text of the abstract goes here.  If you need to use a \section
% command you will need to use \section*, \subsection*, etc. so that
% you don't get any numbering.  You probably won't be using any of
% these commands in the abstract anyway.

% Text shouldn't exceed 350 words including everything on the page

\lipsum[40] \par
